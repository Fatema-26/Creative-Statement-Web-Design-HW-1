<h1>Reading and Written Response #1</h1>

<p>
In “In Plato's Cave,” Susan Sontag explains how photography changes the way we see the world. She argues that taking photographs is not just about capturing reality but about shaping it. Photographs influence how we understand events, people and even ourselves. Reading this made me think about how often I use images in my daily life and how powerful they really are.
To me, capturing images means preserving a moment that will never exist again in the same way. A photograph freezes time. It allows us to return to memories and emotions. However, Sontag suggests that photographs also distance us from reality. Instead of fully experiencing a moment, we sometimes focus more on documenting it. This made me reflect on how often people take pictures instead of being present. Especially today, with smartphones and social media, image-taking has become constant and almost automatic.
In our current world, photography is more powerful than ever. Images spread instantly across platforms and shape public opinion. News, protests, wars, celebrations, and personal milestones are all shared visually. A single photograph can create empathy, anger, or inspiration. At the same time, images can also mislead or manipulate. Editing, filters and selective framing change how reality appears. This makes photography both creative and political.
As a media maker, I think about how I can represent our world honestly and thoughtfully. Through photography or illustration, I could show themes like connection, isolation, technology dependence, or cultural identity. For example, I could photograph people looking at their phones in public spaces to show how technology connects and separates us at the same time. I could combine images with text to add deeper meaning, showing contrast between appearance and reality.
Throughout this semester, we are creating nine different projects using different tools. Although each project is separate, I see them as connected pieces of one larger story. Each project is an opportunity to explore how images communicate meaning. As I learn new tools, I am not just learning technical skills, I am also learning how to express ideas visually. Each project can build on the last by exploring related themes, improving composition, and developing a consistent style.
Sontag’s reading reminds me that photography is never neutral. When I choose what to photograph, how to frame it and when to capture it, I am making decisions that shape meaning. Being aware of this responsibility will help me grow as a thoughtful and intentional media maker. Photography is not just about images.It is about perspective, power, and represent skill.
