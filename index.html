    <h1>Fatema Khanam</h1>
    <p>My major is currently undeclared but I am deciding between Biology and Computer Science. I took this class to learn html, coding skills and how to use GitHub. I am also interested in visual communication and interactive design. This class will help me to build a foundation in these areas.</p>
    <p>One of my hobbies is crafting because it allows me to be creative and relax. I enjoy making things by hand and turning simple materials into something unique. Crafting helps me express my ideas visually and improves my focus. It is a fun way to explore different styles and techniques. I have a link to an image that represents crafting in the link below called Image link.</p>
