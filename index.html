    <p>Hello!I am Fatema Khanam.My major is currently undeclared, but I am deciding between Biology and Computer Science. I took this class to learn HTML, basic coding skills, photography and how to use GitHub. I want to understand how websites are built and how technology can be used creatively. I am also interested in visual communication and interactive design, especially how users interact with digital content. This class will help me build a strong foundation in these areas and support my future academic goals.</p>
    <p>One of my hobbies is crafting because it allows me to be creative and helps me relax. I enjoy making things by hand and turning simple materials into something unique and meaningful. Crafting helps me express my ideas visually and improves my focus and patience. It also inspires my interest in design by allowing me to experiment with colors, shapes and textures. It is a fun way to explore different styles and techniques. I have included a link to an image below that represents crafting and my creative interests.</p>
